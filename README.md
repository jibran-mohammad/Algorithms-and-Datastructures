# Algorithms-and-Datastructures
Basic algorithm and datastructres
In this project I am implementing the basic Algorithm and datastructures to get a high level view as well as in-depth understanding of the algorithms which will serve 
as base for all the practice problems you might do later. So before grinding leetcode, take a look at these probelms to understand the underlying concepts.
